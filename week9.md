## CSE Labs Done Quick

The lab activities this quarter were overall enjoyable, but my favorite had to be from week 7. In this lab, we completed the following steps:

1) Log in to the remote ieng6 server (after setting up your account to generate SSH keys)
2) Clone a fork of the given lab 7 repository
3) Run the tests from the `.java` files from the above repository
4) Edit the code to resolve any failed tests
5) Run the tests again to demonstrate the newly corrected code passing the tests
6) Commit and push the changes to Github

The main learning objective of this lab was to increase efficiency of typing commands using various shortcuts 
(i.e. using the `tab` key to finish typing a file name, pressing the `up arrow` to re-use a line of code previously entered).
While knowing subtle tricks is useful to save time in the long run, this lab provided me with a vision for how using 
command line language can be incredibly useful; when working on remote files located on remote servers.

Until this point in the course, I thought command lines were an interesting way to manage and work on files stored 
on your computer, though I didn't really understand the appeal since those same tasks can be completed visually on your
local desktop. However, after this lab, it finally clicked with me that you can log into a remote server, edit files
and run code that are stored remotely, and finalize those changes all from your own local device.

This is a powerful tool that has a wide variety of applications, from collaborating on a group project stored remotely
so that all members can easily access files and make edits to code, to accessing and making use of data that you need
but isn't stored on your local device.

This lab helped me see what a typical remote project could look like: log in to the remote server, run the tests and
make edits to your code as needed (using NANO, the text editor for linux command line), and commit/push those updates to Github.

This brings a sense of utility and purpose to the activities performed and learned in this class, providing a vision for 
the situations in which using command line language can be applicable.
